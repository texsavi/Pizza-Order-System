```python
myStuff = [] # Didn't create the list.

try:
  f.open("Stuff.mine","r")
  myStuff = eval(f.read())
  f.close()
# The 'open' lines weren't indented inside the 'try'

except Exception as err:
  print("ERROR: Unable to load")
  print(err)
# Missing 'except'

for row in myStuff:
  print(row)
```
